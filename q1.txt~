let rec concat l = match l with
| [] -> ""
| x::xs -> x ^ (concat xs)

let concat' l =
let rec conc l acc = match l with
| [] -> acc
| x::xs -> conc xs (acc ^ x)
in
conc l ""

Prove that concat l produces the same as concat' l.

Intuitively this is clear as both functions start off with the same initial state
and keep joining elements together until the list is empty, the only difference beingthat concat' uses an inner function conc so as to store the result in an accumulator
variable. concat' is better in the sense that there is no danger of a stack overflow since the string we want to eventually return is being stored in 'acc' rather than onthe stack.

formal proof: (this is extremely boring)

NTS concat 1 = concat' 1

Base Case: l = []

concat l = concat [] = "" = conc [] "" = concat' [] = concat' l

the first equality is due to the definition of l in the base case
the second equality is by the program concat
the third and fourth  equalities are by the program concat'
